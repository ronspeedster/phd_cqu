**Note:** This page describes how to use the command line version of Hypermut 3. [Here](https://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/HYPERMUT/hypermutv3.html) is a link to the webtool.

Hypermut 3: Identifying specific mutational patterns in a defined nucleotide context that allows multistate characters\

bioRxiv 2024.10.24.620069; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.10.24.620069 

**Primary purpose:** Analysis and detection of APOBEC3F- and APOBEC3G-induced hypermutation. 
See [here](https://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/HYPERMUT/Readme.html) for more details on hypermutation. 

**General purpose:** To document the nature and context of nucleotide substitutions in a sequence population relative to a reference sequence.

## Overview

Hypermut 3 allows searching for mutations fitting a pattern you specify. 
The positions that match the upstream context pattern, followed by the specified mutation (relative to the reference sequence, 
assumed to be the first entered, and treated as ancestral) followed by the downstream context will be found. 
Matching can be performed in strict or partial mode and accounts for multistate characters. 
Matches to the opposite control pattern will be shown for comparison. 
The context requirements can be enforced on the reference sequence, on the query sequence (recommended, especially if the reference is distant) or both. 
Fisher's exact test is then used to detect any increase of mutation for the specified context compared to the control context.

## Installation

Hypermut 3 is written in Python3 and requires the `scipy` package. 

To clone this repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/MolEvolEpid/hypermut3
```

If desired, the `hypermut_env.yaml` file can be used to create a conda environment with the (very minimal) required dependencies (if you already have Python3 and scipy installed, you don't need to do this). First, install [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/mamba-installation.html). Then, run the following command from the `hypermut` directory:

```
mamba env create -f hypermut_env.yaml
```

This will create a hypermut conda environment that can be activated using:

```
conda activate hypermut
```

## Running Hypermut 3

Aligned sequences in fasta file format are required as input.
The first sequence in the alignment will be used as the reference sequence, and each of the other sequences will be used as a query sequence. 
Please choose the reference sequence carefully (see details below). 

To search for hypermutation by APOBEC3G or APOBEC3F using the example fasta file, you can run the command:

```
python hypermut.py example/example.fasta G A -d RD
```

The positional inputs are as follows:

```
  fasta                 Alignment file in fasta format
  mutationfrom          Base in the reference to consider as a site of interest for nucleotide substitution
  mutationto            Base in the query to consider a nucleotide substitution of interest
```

The optional arguments include:

```
-h, --help            show this help message and exit
--upstreamcontext UPSTREAMCONTEXT, -u UPSTREAMCONTEXT
                      Upstream nucleotide context of interest (default: no upstream context)
--downstreamcontext DOWNSTREAMCONTEXT, -d DOWNSTREAMCONTEXT
                      Downstream nucleotide context of interest (default: no downstream context)
--prefix PREFIX, -p PREFIX
                      Prefix for output files (default: no prefix).
--enforce {A,D,B}, -e {A,D,B}
                      What sequence to enforce the context on:
                      ancestor/reference (A), descendant/query (D, default), or both (B)
--match {strict,partial}, -m {strict,partial}
                      Whether to include only complete matches (strict, default),
                      or also include partial matches (not completely overlapping
                      bases between query and context, partial)
--keepgaps, -k        Flag indicating to keep gaps in the alignment when
                      identifying pattern matches (default without flag is to skip gaps)
--begin BEGIN, -b BEGIN
                      Position at which to start searching for mutations (default: 0).
                      Note that the context may fall outside of these positions.
--finish FINISH, -f FINISH
                      Position at which to end searching for mutations (default: end of sequence).
                      Note that the context may fall outside of these positions.
```

## Details

**Mutations:**

- The mutations to and from must only be one nucleotide. 

**Context:**

- As in regular expressions, the symbol "|" means "OR". Thus GGT|GAA matches GGT or GAA.
- Unlike Hypermut 2.0, () **CANNOT** be used for grouping (i.e.,  G(GT|AA) is wrong, instead use GGT|GAA).
- All of the [IUPAC codes](https://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/HelpDocs/IUPAC.html) are supported (e.g., R means G or A, while D means not C).
- Contexts can be multiple characters, but mutations can only be one character. 
- The upstream and downstream context patterns must always match a fixed number of nucleotides.
  For example, A|TC is not allowed as a pattern because it could have length 1 or 2.

**Reference sequence:**

- The first sequence in the fasta file.
- In strict matching mode (see below), can contain IUPAC characters and gaps (`-`). 
- In partial matching mode (see below), can only contain non-multistate characters (ACGT) and gaps (`-`).
- For an intrapatient set, the reference could be the strict/majority consensus of all the sequences, assuming that the majority are not hypermutated.
  - For more details about strict/majority consensus making, and a webtool, see [here](https://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/CONSENSUS/consensus.html).
- For a set of unrelated sequences, the reference should probably be the strict/majority consensus sequence for the appropriate subtype.
  - For pre-made subtype strict/majority consensus sequences for HIV, see [here](https://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/NEWALIGN/align.html). 
  
**Query sequence(s):**

- Can contain [IUPAC nucleotide codes](https://www.bioinformatics.org/sms/iupac.html) (T, not U) and gaps (`-`).
- Contexts where the mutation in the query is a gap are ignored and not considered potential mutations.
- If the query sequence contains multistate characters, they can be treated as follows: 
  - **Strict** (default): Only completely inclusive matches containing multistate characters are considered (for the mutation and the context). 
    - For a mutation site, the entire site is not considered if there is a partial match, e.g. if the context is correct but the primary mutation is `A` and the query mutation is `R`. 
    - For the context, if the primary downstream context is `DT`, then `RT` would be considered the correct context. However, `NT` would not be considered the correct context. 
    - This makes sense if the sequencing is from single clones and you don't want to consider ambiguous matches.
  - **Partial**: Partially overlapping matches (for the mutation and the context) are considered.  
    - For a mutation site, if the primary mutation is `A` and the query mutation is `R`, then this would be considered a 50% match. 
    - For the context, if the primary downstream context is `DT`, then a query `NT` context would be split between primary (75%) and control (25%) patterns. 
    - This makes sense if the sequence is derived from a population.

## Example script for cumulative plot

Sometimes it is useful to look at the plot of cumulative number of potential match sites vs. cumulative number of actual matches. 
We provide an R script that you can use to create this plot. To create this plot, you must have R (version 4) installed as well as the following 
packags: readr, dplyr, ggplot2, and stringr (all come with the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)).

The script requires as input the positions file output by `hypermut.py`, and will output a pdf and png version of the plot with the same prefix as the positions file with the suffix "_cumplot". Feel free to customize the script however you'd like. 

```
Rscript cumplot.R positions.csv
```

Here is a comparison of the example data run in strict and partial modes using code similar to that in `cumplot.R` (see the `example` folder and corresponding `README.md` for more details on exactly how this was generated):

## Tests

To run the unit tests for the functions used in `hypermut.py`, you need `pytest` and `pytest-cov` (which are included in the conda environment). Then you can run the command:

```
pytest test_hypermut.py
```

To also get the code coverage, run:
```
pytest test_hypermut.py --cov --cov-report=html
```

You can open 'htmlcov/index.html' to browse the code coverage.
